# Mapping Earthquakes
## Overview
### Purpose
The goal of this project was to create an interactive map that displays earthquake data from the past 7 days. The data was sourced from earthquake GeoJSON data from the US Geological Survey website found here: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php.

The project also includes data on tectonic plates from the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates
### Description
The map includes 3 background layer options as well as toggles for all earthquake data, tectonic plate lines, and major earthquake data. Each earthquake is represented by a circle marker where the size and color of the marker is based on the magnitude of the earthquake. Users can click on an earthquake circle to see a popup with the earthquake's magnitude and location.
